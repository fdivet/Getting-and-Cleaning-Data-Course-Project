The code below is annoted with the various steps explained in more or less details.

In the first part of the code, I define the path of the folder in which the data is available

I define as well some names that will be the same for the train and test data (such as "X_", "y_"...)

I then get the name of the various columns that will be used later

I dowload the three files (data with the recorded information, the activity and the subject for all 
the information recorded) for both thr train and test dataset

I merge them to have one dataset with all the inforamtion for both the train and test

I merge the train and test information

In the names of the column I select only the ones having either mean or std in the label

I then select only the column corresponding to the mean and standard deviation (std)

I use the aggregate function to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
